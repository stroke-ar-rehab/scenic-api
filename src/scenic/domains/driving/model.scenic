"""Scenic world model for scenarios using the driving domain.

Imports actions and behaviors for dynamic agents from
:doc:`scenic.domains.driving.actions` and :doc:`scenic.domains.driving.behaviors`.

The map file to use for the scenario must be specified before importing this model by
defining the global parameter ``map``. This path is passed to the `Network.fromFile`
function to create a `Network` object representing the road network. Extra options may be
passed to the function by defining the global parameter ``map_options``, which should be
a dictionary of keyword arguments. For example, we could write::

    param map = localPath('mymap.xodr')
    param map_options = { 'tolerance': 0.1 }
    model scenic.domains.driving.model

If you are writing a generic scenario that supports multiple maps, you may leave the
``map`` parameter undefined; then running the scenario will produce an error unless the
user uses the :option:`--param` command-line option to specify the map.

The ``use2DMap`` global parameter determines whether or not maps are generated in 2D. Currently
3D maps are not supported, but are under development. By default, this parameter is `False`
(so that future versions of Scenic will automatically use 3D maps), unless
:ref:`2D compatibility mode` is enabled, in which case the default is `True`. The parameter
can be manually set to `True` to ensure 2D maps are used even if the scenario is not compiled
in 2D compatibility mode.


.. note::

    If you are using a simulator, you may have to also define simulator-specific global
    parameters to tell the simulator which world to load. For example, our LGSVL
    interface uses a parameter ``lgsvl_map`` to specify the name of the Unity scene.
    See the :doc:`documentation <scenic.simulators>` of the simulator interfaces for
    details.
